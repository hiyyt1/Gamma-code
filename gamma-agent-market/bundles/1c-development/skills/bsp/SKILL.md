## Gamma / OpenCode adaptation

This skill runs inside the selected Gamma 1C profile. Load other shipped skills with the native `skill` tool as `1c-development:<name>`; slash examples are skill references, not installed commands. Only names listed by the native skill tool are installed. Optional upstream skills (for example epf-build, erf-build, cf-load, skd-info or skd-styles) are not part of this bundle; do not call them. Use native read for source inspection, or report the missing capability. Binary build/load commands require the separately installed platform. Use native `read`, `glob`, `grep`, file editing and `bash` tools. Do not invoke Claude-only tools or unavailable commercial services. BSL semantic tools use the connected `gamma-bsl` MCP; its connection must be checked first. If unavailable, report that gap and use the supplied source validators. Never fabricate tool results.

Resource paths below are rendered from the verified installed bundle, independently of the project cwd. Use the configured Python interpreter (GAMMA_1C_PYTHON; Python 3.10+ with lxml), not PowerShell. Run scripts with explicit absolute project input/output paths; inspect their --help before use. Never modify installed resources or unrelated files. EDT sources can be inspected but these XML generators target Designer XML exports; do not rewrite EDT .mdo as Designer XML. Preserve UUIDs, format version, existing project conventions and unrelated changes. Check XML and BSL after editing. Source validation is not compilation/testing in 1C; building CF/CFE/EPF/ERF and running an infobase needs the separately installed licensed platform. Do not install or launch commercial MCPs or call paid APIs.

# Using 1C:BSP 3.1.11 in application code

This router is ASCII-only so that its initial read is safe even with a legacy
Windows stdout code page. The task references remain UTF-8 Russian, with exact
BSL names, signatures, regions, parameters, examples and pitfalls.

## Reading UTF-8 files on Windows

Use a native UTF-8 reader: `rg -n . -- "PATH"` reads a file; rg patterns and
`-A`/`-B`/`-C` select a section. Replace PATH with the installed file's path;
quote paths containing spaces. Alternatively, read with explicit Python UTF-8:

```bash
"{{PYTHON}}" -X utf8 -c "import sys; from pathlib import Path; sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding='utf-8'); print(Path(sys.argv[1]).read_text(encoding='utf-8'))" "PATH"
```

`Get-Content -Encoding UTF8` controls input decoding, not captured stdout.
Avoid PowerShell content cmdlets and piping native readers through
`Select-String`, `Select-Object` or `Where-Object`: they may re-encode stdout.
Filter inside rg or Python instead. Apply UTF-8 reading to project files too;
do not combine a safe skill read with an unsafe README read. Do not change
global shell settings.

## Workflow

Scope precedence: explicit BSP API review, including checking whether a method
exists, requires the selected reference even when the recommendation uses
platform APIs. Apply the version boundary below first. Standalone platform-only
requests without BSP API review are outside this workflow; answer them directly.
The presence of BSL files or a form element alone is not an integration task.
A library-based migration/update write is an integration task even without
an explicit BSP name or version; route it to `update.md` after the version check.

1. Check the requested BSP version. For a different version, explain that
   these 3.1.11 references cannot confirm its signatures and request matching
   documentation/export; this boundary check needs no API reference. For
   3.1.11 or an unspecified version, select one primary reference from the
   task table. Add a second only for a genuinely cross-cutting task, such as
   printing in a background job.
2. Bind the installed root to the parent of the absolute `SKILL.md` file
   you successfully opened. Build the selected path as
   `INSTALLED_ROOT/references/REFERENCE.md`; each skill has its own root.
   Open that file before an integration/API answer. Locate the scenario
   using native `rg -n` headings/context, then check its rules, signature,
   example and pitfalls. The router and remembered knowledge are insufficient.
   If a search fails, run the reference fallback below using that same
   absolute `SKILL.md` path. A project file listing may omit hidden `.agents/`;
   it does not prove the installed reference is absent. A system skill's
   path is not the root of this project skill. Declare the reference
   unavailable only after the fallback fails; otherwise use its scenario.
3. If the user proposes a call or rule, check its original full
   `Module.Method` name and purpose. Identify mismatches explicitly. An API
   signature verified for 3.1.11 is not verification for another BSP version.
4. Prefer the stable public programmatic-interface region. Internal or
   deprecated APIs require an explicit warning and no public alternative.
   Show overridable-module hooks as implementations: BSP calls them;
   application code implements them, not a direct qualified module call.
   Exact Russian region and suffix names are documented in `fundamentals.md`.
5. If a configuration XML export containing `CommonModules/` is available,
   additionally verify each recommended signature/region with `bsp_api.py`.
   Otherwise use the supplied reference and do not claim source verification.
6. Answer in the user's language: API, client/server execution context,
   minimal BSL example and important constraints. Check each full BSP call
   name and argument order against the reference or available export.
   Take application-specific object/handler names from the task or project;
   do not invent symmetric BSP methods. Discuss absent/internal/forbidden
   calls in prose or inline code, not a runnable fenced BSL example.

The skill is self-contained and needs no developer documentation or source
export. Resolve `references/` and `scripts/` relative to this installed
`SKILL.md`, not the project's working directory. `src/cf/` is only an example
export path, not a consumer project requirement.

## Reference fallback

Replace ABSOLUTE_SKILL_MD with the file you opened (use forward slashes),
and REFERENCE.md with the selected table entry. This reads independently of cwd:

```bash
"{{PYTHON}}" -X utf8 -c "from pathlib import Path; p=Path('ABSOLUTE_SKILL_MD').parent/'references'/'REFERENCE.md'; print(p.read_text(encoding='utf-8'))"
```

## Task routing

| Primary task | Reference |
|---|---|
| Module suffixes, locating modules, subsystem map, stable API vs hooks | `references/fundamentals.md` |
| User messages (including binding to a field during server validation), XML/JSON, attributes by reference, secure storage, strings, dates, temporary directories | `references/base-common.md`; add `references/forms-validation.md` for additional-attribute validation |
| Background/long-running operations, progress, scheduled jobs | `references/longs-and-jobs.md` |
| Object numbering prefix, infobase prefix, data area | `references/prefixes.md` |
| Infobase upgrade/version, migration, update handler | `references/update.md` |
| Data exchange, exchange nodes, change registration | `references/data-exchange.md` |
| Electronic signatures, machine-readable powers of attorney (MCD), cryptography, DSS, signature checks | `references/esign-mcd.md` |
| Contact information, addresses, OKTMO/KLADR, address classifier | `references/contact-info.md` |
| Other classifiers, including countries | `references/classifiers.md` |
| Currencies, exchange rates, banks/accounts, work schedules/calendars | `references/currencies-banks.md` |
| External components, OData | `references/external-components.md` |
| Users, permissions, RLS, access groups/profiles | `references/users-access.md` |
| Email, SMS, message templates, discussions/interactions | `references/comms.md` |
| Business processes and tasks | `references/bp-tasks.md` |
| User-session termination, deleting marked objects, security profiles | `references/admin-tools.md` |
| Infobase backup | `references/backup.md` |
| Performance assessment, monitoring center, user activity | `references/perf-monitoring.md` |
| Personal-data protection/destruction dates, classification labels | `references/protection-pd.md` |
| Connected commands, external reports/processors | `references/commands-external.md` |
| Printing, print manager, report variants, data composition (SKD) | `references/print-reports.md` |
| Locking/unlocking form attributes, properties, change-prohibition dates | `references/forms-validation.md` |
| Files, volumes, versioning, writing a file | `references/files-and-versions.md` |
| Multilingual code, NStr, current language, localization | `references/multilang.md` |
| Duplicates, bulk modification, subordinate structure, reference replacement | `references/report-dedup.md` |

For an unmapped BSP task, start with `fundamentals.md`. It also lists intentionally
uncovered subsystems. References are workflows, not just a searchable method
catalog: use the complete scenario, not an isolated matching name.

## Optional configuration-export verification

Replace SKILL_DIR with this installed skill directory, CF_EXPORT with the
export root containing `CommonModules/`, and MODULE/METHOD with real names.
The export is read-only and not bundled. Python UTF-8 mode keeps CLI output
readable on Windows without changing global settings.

```bash
# Signature, region, documentation, source path and line range.
"{{PYTHON}}" -X utf8 "SKILL_DIR/scripts/bsp_api.py" method METHOD --module MODULE --src "CF_EXPORT"

# One module's exported methods across all regions.
"{{PYTHON}}" -X utf8 "SKILL_DIR/scripts/bsp_api.py" module MODULE --src "CF_EXPORT"

# Modules exposing stable public API.
"{{PYTHON}}" -X utf8 "SKILL_DIR/scripts/bsp_api.py" modules --src "CF_EXPORT"
```

`--module` disambiguates same-named methods. `--src` is mandatory: no automatic
export discovery; missing paths or `CommonModules/` yield a nonzero exit code.
`module` includes all regions; `modules` lists stable API modules only. The
output marks hooks, internal and deprecated methods; retain these warnings.

A text search of subsystem XML can locate a common-module reference, but
assigning Catalog/Document objects to a subsystem requires parsing its
`Item` references, including nested subsystem XML, not a guessed grep match.
